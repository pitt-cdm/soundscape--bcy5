In my preview so far, I laid out the foundation for the story of a traveler, who in a small town, accepts a quest via a wanted poster. In the background, there is an ambiance sounds of the town that he often travels to accepts quests. Sounds such as the whinnying of a horse, and sound of the traveler’s footsteps can be heard. Once he reaches the quest bulletin board, he is greeted by women who offers her help in choosing his next quest among the many hundreds of other quest scrolls attached to the board. In the preview, we can hear the main character pick up a quest paper that seems to fit his interest. And in a few moments, we can hear the hero panting as he traverses into the forest to find the monster that he needs to eliminate. 
The audio files of the town’s ambiance, horse whinny, the woman’s voice, and the footsteps on pavement were pre-recorded sounds found on freesound.org and the panting and the paper audio sound were recorded by me. Because it is hard to record the sound of an ambiance, horse whinny, I decided to use a pre-recorded audio file in my project. 
My next step is to work on a transition between the town portion and the “traversing into the forest” portion of the audio so that it is clear that there was a time skip as the main character searches for his enemy. Also, many sound effects will be used to lay out a scene of our main character battling an enemy in order to finish his quest. Sounds such as kitchen knives can be used to imitate the character’s sword and recordings of footsteps in the grass can be used to depict the character’s hike in the woods to find his enemy.
